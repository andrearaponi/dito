### üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation (Advanced)

1.  **Build Dito:**
    ```bash
    go build -o bin/dito ./cmd/dito/main.go
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure the path to `main.go` is correct, e.g., `./cmd/dito/main.go` if `main.go` is in `cmd/dito/`)*

2.  **Build plugin-signer:**
    ```bash
    cd cmd/plugin-signer && go build -o ../../bin/plugin-signer . && cd ../..
    ```

3.  **Generate keys:**
    ```bash
    ./bin/plugin-signer generate-keys
    ```
    *(This will create keys in the current directory, presumably `bin/` if run from there, or the project root. Move them to `bin/` if needed or specify paths)*

4.  **Build plugins:**
    ```bash
    find plugins -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec sh -c 'cd "$1" && go build -buildmode=plugin -o "$(basename "$1").so"' sh {} \;
    ```

5.  **Sign plugins:**
    ```bash
    find plugins -name "*.so" -exec ./bin/plugin-signer sign {} \;
    ```
    *(Ensure `plugin-signer` can find the private keys; you might need to specify `-privateKey path/to/key`)*

6.  **Update `config.yaml`** (ensure `public_key_path` & `public_key_hash` are correct).

7.  **Run Dito:**
    ```bash
    ./bin/dito
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Start with default config:
```bash
make run
```

Or directly:
```bash
./bin/dito -f /path/to/custom-config.yaml -enable-profiler
```

### Config File
*   **Template:** `cmd/config.yaml` (or the correct path to your template)
*   **Runtime:** `bin/config.yaml` (auto-updated by `make setup` or `make quick-start`)

Key fields:
```yaml
port: '8081'
hot_reload: true
metrics:
  enabled: true
  path: "/metrics"
logging:

      X-Custom: "true"
    excluded_headers:
      - Cookie
    middlewares:
      - hello-plugin # Plugin name as defined in its directory
```

## üîå Plugin System

Dito uses Go plugins (.so files). Each plugin must:
1.  Be in its own subdirectory under `plugins/`.
2.  Contain:
    *   `<plugin-name>.so`
    *   `<plugin-name>.so.sig` (signature file)
    *   `config.yaml` (plugin-specific config, optional but common)

### Signing & Verification
*   **Mandatory:** Dito will not start without valid plugin signing.
*   Uses Ed25519 digital signatures.

Steps (if done manually):
1.  **Generate key pair:**
    ```bash
    ./bin/plugin-signer generate-keys -privateKey ed25519_private.key -publicKey ed25519_public.key
    ```
    *(Save these keys securely, e.g., in `bin/` or a dedicated directory)*

2.  **Compute public key hash:**
    ```bash
    shasum -a 256 ed25519_public.key | awk '{print $1}'
    ```
    *(Ensure the path to `ed25519_public.key` is correct)*

3.  **Update Dito's `config.yaml`** with `public_key_path` (e.g., `./bin/ed25519_public.key`) and the computed `public_key_hash`.

4.  **Sign plugin:**
    ```bash
    ./bin/plugin-signer sign -plugin path/to/plugin.so -privateKey path/to/ed25519_private.key
    ```
    *(This will create a `.sig` file next to the plugin's `.so` file)*

## üêõ Troubleshooting

*   **`public key integrity validation failed`**: Regenerate hash and update config. Ensure the hash exactly matches the specified public key file.
*   **`failed to read public key`**: Check public key file path in `config.yaml` & file permissions.
*   **`plugin signature verification failed`**: Re-sign with correct private key. Ensure public key in `config.yaml` matches the private key used for signing.


## Custom Transport Configuration

This allows for fine-grained control over how Dito connects to backend services, including:

- **Timeouts and Connection Limits**: Configure timeouts and maximum connections to handle backend service behavior.
- **TLS Settings**: Manage TLS handshake timeouts and enforce HTTP/2 if needed.
- **Custom Certificates**: Specify client certificates for mTLS connections to backends.

### WebSocket Support

Dito supports WebSocket proxying, allowing you to seamlessly forward WebSocket connections to your backend servers. This can be configured per location, enabling WebSocket support on specific routes.

#### Configuration

To enable WebSocket support, add `enable_websocket: true` to the location configuration. Here‚Äôs an example:

```yaml
# List of location configurations for proxying requests.
locations:
  - path: "^/test-ws$" # Regex pattern to match the request path.
    target_url: "wss://echo.websocket.org" # The target URL to which the request will be proxied.
    enable_websocket: true # Enable WebSocket support for this location.
    replace_path: true # Replace the matched path with the target URL.
```
#### Upcoming Enhancements

Future versions of Dito will include more advanced WebSocket features, such as:

- **Enhanced TLS Support**: Configurable TLS settings for secure WebSocket connections, allowing for encrypted communication and improved security.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Improved resilience and error management for WebSocket connections to ensure stability during unexpected interruptions.
- **Detailed Metrics**: Real-time metrics for WebSocket traffic, enabling better performance monitoring and insight into connection stability and throughput.

These features aim to provide full control, security, and reliability for WebSocket connections in Dito, enhancing the overall communication experience.


### TLS/SSL

Dito supports mTLS (mutual TLS) for secure connections to backends. You can specify:

- `cert_file`: The client certificate.
- `key_file`: The client private key.
- `ca_file`: The certificate authority (CA) for verifying the backend.

## Metrics

Dito supports monitoring through Prometheus by exposing various metrics related to the proxy's performance and behavior. The metrics are accessible at the configured path (default is `/metrics`).

### Available Metrics

Dito provides both custom metrics and standard metrics from the Go runtime and Prometheus libraries:

#### Custom Metrics
- **`http_requests_total`**: Total number of HTTP requests processed, partitioned by method, path, and status code.
- **`http_request_duration_seconds`**: Duration of HTTP requests in seconds, with predefined buckets.
- **`active_connections`**: Number of active connections currently being handled by the proxy.
- **`data_transferred_bytes_total`**: Total amount of data transferred in bytes, partitioned by direction (`inbound` or `outbound`).

#### Standard Metrics
- **Go runtime metrics**: Metrics such as memory usage, garbage collection statistics, and the number of goroutines, which are automatically exposed by the Go Prometheus client library. Examples include:
   - `go_goroutines`: Number of goroutines currently running.
   - `go_memstats_alloc_bytes`: Number of bytes allocated in the heap.
   - `go_gc_duration_seconds`: Duration of garbage collection cycles.
- **Prometheus HTTP handler metrics**: Metrics related to the Prometheus HTTP handler itself, such as:
   - `promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total`: Total number of HTTP requests handled by the metrics endpoint.
   - `promhttp_metric_handler_requests_in_flight`: Current number of scrapes being served.

### Configuration Example

To enable metrics, make sure the following section is present in the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
metrics:
   enabled: true # Enable or disable metrics.
   path: "/metrics" # The path on which the metrics will be exposed.
```
