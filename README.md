**Dito** is an advanced reverse proxy server written in Go. It provides flexible middleware support, custom certificate handling for backend connections, dynamic configuration reloading, and distributed caching and rate limiting with Redis.

## Features

- **Layer 7 Reverse Proxy**: Handles HTTP and HTTPS requests efficiently.
- **Dynamic Configuration Reloading** (`hot reload`): Update configurations without restarting the server.
- **Middleware Support**: Easily integrate custom middleware for authentication, rate limiting, caching, etc.
- **Distributed Rate Limiting with Redis**: Control request rates across multiple instances.
- **Distributed Caching with Redis**: Improve performance by caching responses.
- **Custom TLS Certificate Management**: Support for mTLS and custom certificates for backend connections.
- **Header Manipulation**: Add or remove HTTP headers as needed.
- **Advanced Logging**: Asynchronous logging with customizable verbosity and performance optimizations.
- **Custom Transport Configuration**: Fine-tune HTTP transport settings per location or globally.
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Monitor performance and behavior with detailed metrics.

## Installation

Make sure you have Go installed (version 1.16 or later).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andrearaponi/dito.git
   cd dito
   ```

2. Build the application:

   ```bash
   go build -o dito ./cmd
   ```

## Usage

You can run Dito by simply executing the binary. By default, it looks for `config.yaml` in the current working directory.

```bash
./dito
```

### Command-Line Options

- `-f <path/to/config.yaml>`: Specify a custom configuration file.

Example:

```bash
./dito -f /path/to/custom-config.yaml
```

## Configuration

The configuration is defined in a `yaml` file, which can be dynamically reloaded if the `hot_reload` option is enabled. Hereâ€™s an example of a basic configuration:

```yaml
# Configuration for the proxy server.
port: '8081' # The port on which the server will listen.
hot_reload: true # Enable hot reloading of the configuration file.

# Logging configuration.
logging:

```

## Middlewares

Dito supports custom middlewares, which can be specified in the configuration. Currently available middleware includes:

- `auth`: Adds authentication logic.
- `rate-limiter`: Limits the number of requests per IP using an in-memory approach.
- `rate-limiter-redis`: Limits the number of requests per IP using Redis for distributed management.
- `cache`: Caches responses using Redis, improving performance for idempotent responses (e.g., GET).

### Middleware Execution Order

The order in which middlewares are applied is critical for ensuring proper functionality. For example:

- If the `rate-limiter` middleware is applied before `auth`, requests might be throttled before authentication is checked. This could lead to unauthorized requests consuming rate limit tokens.
- Similarly, applying `cache` before `auth` could result in cached responses being served to unauthenticated users, which is not ideal for secure endpoints.

#### Example Middleware Order:

1. `rate-limiter-redis`: Throttles requests to protect the backend.
2. `auth`: Ensures that only authenticated users can access the API.
3. `cache`: Caches responses to reduce load on backends for repeated requests.

To implement a new middleware, place your logic in the `middlewares/` directory and reference it in the configuration.


## Redis Integration

### Rate Limiting

Dito supports distributed rate limiting using Redis. The rate limiter can be configured per location with parameters like `requests_per_second` and `burst` to control the request flow.

### Caching

The `cache` middleware uses Redis to store responses. It helps in reducing load on backends by caching responses for a configurable `ttl` (time-to-live). The cache can be invalidated based on request headers or specific conditions.

### Implementing a New Middleware

To implement a new middleware, place your logic in the `middlewares/` directory and reference it in the configuration.

## Custom Transport Configuration

This allows for fine-grained control over how Dito connects to backend services, including:

- **Timeouts and Connection Limits**: Configure timeouts and maximum connections to handle backend service behavior.
- **TLS Settings**: Manage TLS handshake timeouts and enforce HTTP/2 if needed.
- **Custom Certificates**: Specify client certificates for mTLS connections to backends.


### TLS/SSL

Dito supports mTLS (mutual TLS) for secure connections to backends. You can specify:

- `cert_file`: The client certificate.
- `key_file`: The client private key.
- `ca_file`: The certificate authority (CA) for verifying the backend.

## Metrics

Dito supports monitoring through Prometheus by exposing various metrics related to the proxy's performance and behavior. The metrics are accessible at the configured path (default is `/metrics`).

### Available Metrics

Dito provides both custom metrics and standard metrics from the Go runtime and Prometheus libraries:

#### Custom Metrics
- **`http_requests_total`**: Total number of HTTP requests processed, partitioned by method, path, and status code.
- **`http_request_duration_seconds`**: Duration of HTTP requests in seconds, with predefined buckets.
- **`active_connections`**: Number of active connections currently being handled by the proxy.
- **`data_transferred_bytes_total`**: Total amount of data transferred in bytes, partitioned by direction (`inbound` or `outbound`).

#### Standard Metrics
- **Go runtime metrics**: Metrics such as memory usage, garbage collection statistics, and the number of goroutines, which are automatically exposed by the Go Prometheus client library. Examples include:
   - `go_goroutines`: Number of goroutines currently running.
   - `go_memstats_alloc_bytes`: Number of bytes allocated in the heap.
   - `go_gc_duration_seconds`: Duration of garbage collection cycles.
- **Prometheus HTTP handler metrics**: Metrics related to the Prometheus HTTP handler itself, such as:
   - `promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total`: Total number of HTTP requests handled by the metrics endpoint.
   - `promhttp_metric_handler_requests_in_flight`: Current number of scrapes being served.

### Configuration Example

To enable metrics, make sure the following section is present in the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
metrics:
   enabled: true # Enable or disable metrics.
   path: "/metrics" # The path on which the metrics will be exposed.
```
